## Status

Skira is still in active development. We are working towards a final release ASAP (1.0.0) and will then keep the API stable.

## Installation

Download node at [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org) and install it, if you haven't already.

```sh
npm install -g skira-server
```

## Usage

Inside your project folder you only have to run the following command. It expects build/site.js to be present.

```sh
skira-server
```

## Contributing

We recommend installing the ESLint and JSCS plugins into your editor to instantly check your code against the guidelines. This will make pull requests easier for everyone.
